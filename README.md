 🛰️ TriLoc - Indoor Position Locator App (No GPS)
TriLoc is an innovative Android app designed to estimate the user's 2D indoor position without GPS.  
Using real-world reference objects and trigonometric calculations, the app computes your location in spaces like rooms, offices, or gardens.

🚀 Features
- Estimate your 2D position using only camera angle and object height
- No GPS or external sensors required
- Manual input of object angle and height
- Clean and minimal UI
- 
 📐 Math Behind It
We use the formula: tan(θ) = height / base → base = height / tan(θ)

Where:
- `θ` is the horizontal angle from user to object (entered manually)
- `height` is the known object height from the ground
- Using this, we triangulate the user’s position in 2D space

 📱 Built With
- Java + Android SDK
- Room Database
- Custom Dialogs + RecyclerView
- Material UI + Constraint Layout
